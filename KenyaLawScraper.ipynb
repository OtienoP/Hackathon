The Petitioner argues that these actions violate the residents' rights to a clean and healthy environment and that the community was not consulted in the decision-making process. The Petition requests cancellation of the title deed, prohibition of the factory's construction, and costs for the legal proceedings.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nCase ID: Environment and Land Constitutional Petition E003 of 2024\nSummary: In the case of Environment and Land Constitutional Petition E003 of 2024, the Petitioners, elected members of the Wajir County Assembly, challenge the registration of the 5th Respondent as a wildlife conservancy, alleging violations of constitutional and statutory requirements, lack of community engagement, and adverse impacts on local pastoral communities. The 5th and 7th Respondents assert that the conservancy is community-owned and has followed proper procedures, while the 6th Respondent indicates that the conservancy's registration is still under review. The Petitioners seek various orders, including the quashing of the conservancy's registration and the reinstatement of community land rights, while the Respondents argue the petition is politically motivated and lacks substantive evidence.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nCase ID: Environment and Land Appeal E003 of 2023\nSummary: Summary unavailable\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nCase ID: Environment & Land Case E029 of 2022\nSummary: Summary unavailable\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nCase ID: Environment & Land Case E002 of 2020\nSummary: Summary unavailable\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nCase ID: Environment & Land Case 263 of 2017\nSummary: In Environment & Land Case 263 of 2017, the Plaintiff filed a Notice of Motion on March 15, 2024, seeking to set aside ex parte proceedings from March 4, 2024, and to reopen the case to present additional evidence and witnesses. The Plaintiff's advocate, Donald Rabala, attributed the absence to a scheduling error, claiming it was an inadvertent mistake, as the Plaintiff and witnesses were present on the correct date of March 14, 2024.
