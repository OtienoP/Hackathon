Failure to do so will result in the lapse of leave. Notices are to be issued to both the respondent and the applicant, and the matter is marked as closed.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nCase ID: Criminal Case E047 of 2023\nSummary: In Criminal Case E047 of 2023, accused John Sila Manza and Redempta B. Nthenya John were charged with the murder of three-year-old Stephanie Ninsa, which occurred on August 19, 2022. The court found that the prosecution presented sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case, leading to the decision that the accused must enter a defense. Consequently, the court ordered that the accused be placed on their defense to answer the charges.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nCase ID: Criminal Case E009 of 2025\nSummary: In Criminal Case E009 of 2025, the court ruled on an application for bond by the Accused, charged with murder. Despite opposition from the prosecution and the victim's family, the court granted bail of Kshs. 500,000 with one surety, citing that there were no compelling reasons to deny bond, particularly as there was no threat to the Accused's life from the community. The decision considered the Accused's social exclusion and the nature of the crime but ultimately upheld his constitutional right to bail.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nCase ID: Criminal Case 47 of 2019\nSummary: In Criminal Case 47 of 2019, Kizito Indeche was charged with the murder of Peter Kibathi, but the prosecution failed to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt due to a lack of eyewitness testimony and insufficient investigation. The court noted that the only evidence presented did not convincingly link Indeche to the crime, leading to his acquittal. Consequently, the bond/bail security deposited on his behalf was discharged.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nCase ID: Criminal Case E005 of 2025\nSummary: In Criminal Case E005 of 2025, the court denied the Accused's application for bail due to ongoing hostility from the victim's family and community tensions, which pose a risk to the Accused's safety if released. The pre-bail report and evidence indicated that the Accused had previously been assaulted by the public, and the court deemed it necessary to prioritize community safety and peace. The Accused may revisit the bail application after the first hearing, when tensions are expected to have lessened.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nCase ID: Criminal Case E012 of 2024\nSummary: Summary unavailable\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nCase ID: Civil Appeal 275 of 2019\nSummary: Summary unavailable\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nCase ID: Criminal Application E009 of 2025\nSummary: In Criminal Application E009 of 2025, the applicant seeks leave to appeal out of time against his conviction and life sentence for robbery with violence and rape, originally decided by the Naivasha High Court in 2018. Despite a seven-year delay in filing the appeal, the court granted the application, emphasizing the importance of justice over procedural delays, and directed the applicant to file his notice of appeal within 14 days and the record of appeal within 30 days. The prosecution did not oppose the application due to the lengthy nature of the sentence.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nCase ID: Criminal Application E007 of 2025\nSummary: Summary unavailable\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nCase ID: Criminal Application E018 of 2024\nSummary: Summary unavailable\n--------------------------------------------------\nSuccessfully saved data to table: CaseSummaries\n"]}],"execution_count":1,"metadata":{"microsoft":{"language":"python","language_group":"synapse_pyspark"}},"id":"a5072d97-eaa4-47e0-9d76-9d30609211ad"}],"metadata":{"kernel_info":{"name":"synapse_pyspark"},"kernelspec":{"name":"synapse_pyspark","language":"Python","display_name":"Synapse PySpark"},"language_info":{"name":"python"},"microsoft":{"language":"python","language_group":"synapse_pyspark","ms_spell_check":{"ms_spell_check_language":"en"}},"nteract":{"version":"nteract-front-end@1.0.0"},"spark_compute":{"compute_id":"/trident/default","session_options":{"conf":{"spark.synapse.nbs.session.timeout":"1200000"}}},"dependencies":{"environment":{"environmentId":"d22b4057-df50-4eb7-9177-464460d5aa50","workspaceId":"2fd318dd-01dc-469d-9458-cf03a8fac759"},"lakehouse":{"known_lakehouses":[{"id":"aabcadc0-5204-487b-a5d9-868112270a0a"}],"default_lakehouse":"aabcadc0-5204-487b-a5d9-868112270a0a","default_lakehouse_name":"hackathon","default_lakehouse_workspace_id":"2fd318dd-01dc-469d-9458-cf03a8fac759"}}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
